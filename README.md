# ðŸ›’ ProductVerse

ProductVerse is a full-stack product management application with a **NestJS backend** and a **React + TypeScript frontend**. The backend was the primary focus for this project as I explored and learned NestJS, while the frontend was assembled quickly using templates for layout.
