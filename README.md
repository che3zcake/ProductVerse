# ProductVerse
I have mostly focused on the backend as the framework Nestjs is new to me and I had to learn that as fast as possible. What helped me was my knowledge for backend in other framewrok to quickly get all the things i need. My frontend lacks a lot because I didn't give myself much time for that so I had to copy many templetes to make a frenkeinstein version of what I had envisioned. I was not able to connect the backend and the frontend as I didn't have time to write the logics, even though things were clear for how I wanted to connect the apis which is very sad.

My backend is in the product-verse folder and frontend is in the fe folder.

To run the backend just :
cd productverse/product-verse 
then do :
npm run dev:watch

there are many end points, like http://localhost:3000/
user, user/login, user/signup, user/:id
product, product/create, product/update, product/delete

To ru my frontend just :
cd productverse/fe
then do:
npm run dev
